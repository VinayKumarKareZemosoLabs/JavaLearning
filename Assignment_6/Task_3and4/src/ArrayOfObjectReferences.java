 Task 3:
   Create a class with a constructor that takes a String argument. During construction, print the argument.
   Create an array of object references to this class, but donâ€™t actually create objects to assign into the array.
   When you run the program, notice whether the initialization messages from the constructor calls are printed.

 Task 4:
   Complete the previous exercise by creating objects to attach to the array of references.
